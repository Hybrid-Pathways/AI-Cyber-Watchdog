Background and problem statement:
In my twenty plus years in the Security industry, I have seen major technical and process driven improvements and efficiencies gained in many key areas across information security. 
One area that I do not believe has improved enough is the area of vulnerability management.   The race to discover, assess, coordinate and continuously react to critical vulnerabilities (e.g.  known exploitable or zero days) feels more like a hamster wheel of inefficiency than the well-oiled machine that it should be. 

The largest, most well-funded private and public organizations seem to struggle with this issue with results ranging from the scrambling of resources to address vulnerabilities to large avoidable incidents and news-worthy breaches. 
The need for a different approach to vulnerability management is paramount for organizations seeking to gain speed during a critical window, before an exploitable vulnerability provides an adversary a path to accomplishing their objective.  With the emergence of Generative AI, I believe we have a viable path to solve this problem and build a new security capability.

Solution: 
Build a Privately hosted AI capability that will utilize retrieval-augmented generation, tuned large language models and machine learning to gain immediate insights from internal data sets that you control.  External data sources will be used as a source of enrichment and verification that can reduce the time to identify, assess and respond to a zero day or a known exploitable vulnerability.

This approach and capability allows your security team to focus limited resources on other work that matters(e.g. Incident Response investigations) while the “AI Cyber WatchDog” helps with the tactical work when a new threat or zero day emerges.
This capability also provides your leadership with immediate answers, supportable metrics and the confidence in your AI driven response process that allows you to build toward a future SOC which is driven by data science, AI and efficient automation.
